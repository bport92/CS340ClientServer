# CS340ClientServer

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  Modular Design: I structured the CRUD module in a modular way, with separate functions or methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Each function/method had a clear purpose and was named descriptively, making it easier for other developers to understand and use.
Documentation: I provided thorough documentation for the CRUD module, including comments within the code to explain complex logic or important considerations. This documentation served as a guide for developers who might work with the module in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
